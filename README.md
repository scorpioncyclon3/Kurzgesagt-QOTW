Consider the set of positive digits {1, 2, 3, 4} and the four basic arithmetic expressions {+,–,x,÷}.

Using **each** number once and any of the basic operations (along with parentheses as per convenience), we can generate different positive integers. For example:

1 + ((4 * 3) / 2)  = 7

4 * (3 - 2) + 1.    = 5

(3 - 1/2) * 4          = 10

4 * 3 * (2 + 1)      = 36

Note: Concatenation of numbers is not allowed (i.e. 12 * 34 not allowed).

Using the set {1,2,3,4} we can generate all numbers from 1 to 28, after which we encounter our first non-expressible number 29. That is we can not generate 29 using {1, 2, 3, 4} once and basic operations.

**Question**

Find the set of four distinct positive digits (1 - 9), {a, b, c, d}, where a < b < c < d. for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n to can be obtained.

Post a code, showing your solution :)
